			<h4 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">How therapy benefits? </h4>
			<p class="card-text">
				Psychotherapy, talk or talking therapy, counseling, or simply therapy—no matter the name it’s known by, mental health counseling can benefit people struggling with emotional difficulties, life challenges, and mental health concerns.<br>

				Therapy can help improve symptoms of many mental health conditions. In therapy, people also learn to cope with symptoms that may not respond to treatment right away. Research shows the benefits of therapy last longer than medication alone. Medication can reduce some symptoms of mental health conditions, but therapy teaches people skills to address symptoms on their own. These skills last after therapy ends, and symptoms may continue to improve, making it less likely people will need further treatment.

				Mental health issues are common. Recent statistics from the National Alliance on Mental Health show 1 out of every 5 American adults lives with a mental health condition, while 1 in 25 adults lives with a serious mental health condition.

				But only about 40% of people with mental health issues get help. Untreated mental health issues often get worse and may have other negative effects. They could also lead to:
				<ul>
				<li>Inability to work or go to school</li>
				<li>Difficulty in relationships or taking care of children</li>
				<li>Increased risk of health issues</li>
				<li>Hospitalization</li>
				<li>Suicide</li>
				</ul>
				Suicide is the second leading cause of death for people in the United States between the ages of 10 and 34. About 90% of people who die by suicide in the U.S. lived with a mental health condition.
				<br><br>
				<h4 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Do I “Need” Therapy?</h4>
				Telling someone they should go to therapy or that they need therapy can be stigmatizing. It may be difficult to watch a loved one deal with mental health challenges, but it’s important for people to choose to seek help on their own—as long as they aren’t putting themselves or anyone else in danger.<br>

				Encouraging someone you care about to look into possible therapy options, even offering to review potential therapists with them, is generally a better way to show support. People who feel forced into therapy may feel resistant and find it harder to put in the work needed to make change.<br>

				While therapy can help people work through issues that lead to thoughts of suicide, it’s usually not the best option for people in crisis. If you are in crisis, you can get help right away by reaching out to a suicide helpline through phone, text message, or online chat. You may be encouraged to call or visit the nearest emergency room. A therapist can help support you going forward, once you are no longer in crisis.<br>

				When any type of mental health or emotional concern affects daily life and function, therapy may be recommended. Therapy can help you learn about what you’re feeling, why you might be feeling it, and how to cope.<br>

				People who feel forced into therapy may feel resistant and find it harder to put in the work needed to make change.<br>

				Therapy also offers a safe place to talk through life challenges such as breakups, grief, parenting difficulties, or family struggles. For example, couples counseling can help you and your partner work through relationship troubles and learn new ways of relating to each other. Note that crisis resources, not couples counseling, are typically recommended for abusive relationships.<br><br>

			<h4 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Should I Go To Therapy?</h4>
			<p class="card-text">
				It may take some consideration before you decide you’re ready for therapy. You might want to wait and see if time, lifestyle changes, or the support of friends and family improves whatever you’re struggling with.<br>
				The American Psychological Association suggests considering therapy when something causes distress and interferes with some part of life, particularly when:
				<ul>
				<li>Thinking about or coping with the issue takes up at least an hour each day</li>
				<li>The issue causes embarrassment or makes you want to avoid others</li>
				<li>The issue has caused your quality of life to decrease</li>
				<li>The issue has negatively affected school, work, or relationships</li>
				<li>You’ve made changes in your life or developed habits to cope with the issue</li>
				</ul>
				If you experience any of the following emotions or feelings to the extent that they interfere with life, therapy may help you reduce their effects. It’s especially important to consider getting help if you feel controlled by symptoms or if they could cause harm to yourself or others.<br>
				<ol>
				<li><b>Overwhelm: </b> You might feel like you have too many things to do or too many issues to cope with. You might feel like you can’t rest or even breathe. Stress and overwhelm can lead to serious physical health concerns.</li>
				<li><b>Fatigue: </b> This physical symptom often results from or accompanies mental health issues. It can indicate depression. Fatigue can cause you to sleep more than usual or have trouble getting out of bed in the morning.</li>
				<li><b>Disproportionate rage, anger, or resentment: </b>Everyone feels angry at times. Even passing rage isn’t necessarily harmful. Seeking support to deal with these feelings may be a good idea when they don’t pass, are extreme compared to the situation, or if they lead you to take violent or potentially harmful actions.</li>
				<li><b>Agoraphobia: </b>People with agoraphobia fear being in places where they might experience panic attacks or become trapped. Some people may become unable to leave their houses.</li>
				<li><b>Anxious or intrusive thoughts: </b>It’s normal to worry about things from time to time, but when worry takes up a significant part of your day or causes physical symptoms, therapy can help you deal with it.</li>
				<li><b>Apathy: </b>Losing interest in usual activities, the world around you, or life in general can indicate mental health issues like depression or anxiety.</li>
				<li><b>Hopelessness: </b>Losing hope or motivation, or feeling as if you have no future, can indicate depression or another mental health condition. Feeling hopeless from time to time, especially after a period of difficulty, isn’t uncommon. But when it persists, it may lead to thoughts of suicide.</li>
				<li><b>Social withdrawal: </b>Many people feel better when they’re able to spend at least some time alone. Introverted people may need even more time alone than others. But if you feel distressed around others or fear being with other people, therapy can help you understand and deal with these feelings.</li>
				</ol>			
				<h5 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">YOU DESERVE SUPPORT</h5>
				Psychotherapy can help people cope with a wide range of experiences. Anyone can enjoy the benefits of therapy, whether you want to set life goals or establish healthy relationships. You don’t need to be in a debilitating crisis to get support. 

				If people are proactive about their mental health, they can prevent their concerns from festering into a larger problem. Therapy can provide relief from symptoms and restore one’s quality of life. It can help people learn how to be themselves again. 

				Everyone has emotional challenges. In today’s America, solutions are available to more people than ever. No one needs to suffer alone.	<br>

				People in talk therapy explore their moods and behaviors in a safe place. A mental health professional may provide a fresh perspective on an issue. They can give people a better understanding of their own emotions. Therapists can also teach communication skills to convey those emotions. Therapy can promote one’s self-esteem, relationships, and outlook on life.
				<br>
				Therapy can be particularly helpful for individuals with the following concerns:

				<p><h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">HELP WITH STRESS AND DEPRESSION</h6>
					Depression is one of the most common mental health conditions in the world. It is more than sadness over a setback or a period of mourning after losing a loved one. It is chronic misery that hinders one’s quality of life. Depression often involves sleep problems, appetite changes, and feelings of guilt or apathy.

					Treatment can help individuals with these symptoms. Psychotherapy treatment for depression relies on trust and emotional support. An effective therapist provides people a comfortable, private setting to heal. Together, they examine the causes and potential solutions to their concerns. Therapists help depressed individuals build new ways of thinking and reacting. Therapy can allow people to return to the loved ones and activities that they care about most.

				</p>


				<p><h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">HELP WITH ANXIETY</h6>
					Anxiety is the most common mental health condition seen in the United States. It impacts roughly 18% of the population. Nearly half of individuals diagnosed with depression also experience some form of anxiety. 

					Psychotherapy can help people with anxiety regain their compass in life. A person can provide context for their emotions by identifying the underlying causes. Rather than being paralyzed by fear, they can understand their emotions, accept them, and make real progress toward their goals.

				</p>



				<p><h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">SELF CONFIDENCE AND MOTIVATION</h6>
					Personality factors such as confidence, self-esteem, assertiveness, anger and building resilience need a therapeutic alliance to understand oneself better and deal with core concerns. Research states 80% of experience improved self confidence with a help of a counsellor.

				</p>

				<p><h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">HELP WITH RELATIONSHIPS</h6>
					Psychotherapy can also help individuals improve their relationships. Mental health professionals focus on helping people open lines of communication with each other. People use this treatment to gain perspective on relationship problems that arise. They can also use therapy preventatively when they know trouble is on the horizon. 

					Among the types of therapy for relationships commonly sought:

					Family Therapy can involve both couples and children. Its general aim is to improve nurturing relationships.
					Marriage Counseling is focuses on spousal relationship between two partners. Its goal is to resolve conflict and strengthen a couple’s bond.
